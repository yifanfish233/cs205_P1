# 8-Puzzle Solver

This project contains a Python program to solve the 8-puzzle game using three different search algorithms: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* with Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* with Manhattan Distance heuristic. 

## Introduction

The 8-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order, using as few moves as possible.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas library for Python3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/8-puzzle-solver.git
2. Run the program:
python3 main.py

## Usage

You can run the program and choose different algorithms to solve the puzzle, or run tests to analyze the performance of these three algorithms at different depths of the initial state of the 8-puzzle.
